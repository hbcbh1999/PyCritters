'''This module provides some basic rendering methods for the physics simulations.

It is intended to be completely separate from the simulation code, but should
be useful for testing and visualization. Note that this module uses deprecated
OpenGL methods and shold not be used as a reference for how to write proper
visualization code. Since graphics cards still support these outdated methods
and we want to focus on the algorithms and simulations, we consider this to
be an acceptable tradeoff. In the future, we may replace this module with a
cleaner implementation that uses modern methods.
